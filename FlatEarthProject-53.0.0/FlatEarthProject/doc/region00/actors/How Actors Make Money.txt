/*

Interchange fee. ... In a credit card or debit card transaction, the 
card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee 
from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or 
debit card transaction for a merchant.
 
Visa and Mastercard typically make 0.11% per transaction when a card 
is swiped. The rest goes to the acquirer bank (merchant's bank) and 
issuer (shopper's bank) as mentioned in the answers below. More % goes 
to the shopper's bank since they'll lose money if the shopper defaults 
on their credit card payment.
 
Interchange fees are assessed net of refunds and chargebacks, and most 
are two parts consisting of a percentage and a transaction fee. For example, 
1.51% plus $0.10 is the current Visa interchange fee for a swiped consumer 
credit card.
